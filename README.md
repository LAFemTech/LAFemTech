## Notes
* Please add any suggestions on best practices or formats for maintaining or presenting groups or resources such as this via GitHub.
* LA Fem Tech is loosely based on and inspired by [DC Fem Tech](http://dcfemtech.github.io/about.html).

## To Do's
* Outreach to other groups and maintainers
* Add protected admin section (can be Google Doc or otherwise?) with contact info, venues, etc. for group organizers to use as a resource. Note - please request permission from the venue, sponsor, etc. for you to share their information!
* Add event calendar
* Possibly expand and invite other metro areas to have pages dedicated for their city.
* Figure out a good structure for the front page
