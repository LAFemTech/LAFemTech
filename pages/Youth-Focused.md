_I'd love to figure out how to put together a resource guide for parents. I've had many parents come up to me and ask how to get their girls more interested in (Tech/Code/STEM/Engineering/etc) and would love to have a site that we can point them to that has a list of resources for them to use to encourage their young girls (and boys) to get stoked on tech!_
