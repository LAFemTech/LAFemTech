## To-Do's and Notes
* Add Websites, Meetup links, Socials, etc.

* Possibly move to its own section, and break out "awareness" websites and educational websites

* TBD: Should meetups be separately listed or divided out into the applicable section based on content?

* Also add notes for which groups have an Active LA presence, notations for community groups, non-profits, for-profit organizations

* Groups are listed in alphabetical order so as to be neutral.
